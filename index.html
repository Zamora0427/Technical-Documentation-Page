            <p>What is Programming?</p>

            <p>A simple answer would be, “Programming is the act of instructing computers to carry out tasks.” It is
                often referred to as coding.</p>

            <p>So then, what is a computer program? A computer program is a sequence of instructions that the computer
                executes.</p>

            <p>Computer in the definition above is any device that is capable of processing code. This could be
                smartphones, ATMs, the Raspberry Pi, Servers to name a few.</p>

            <p>A Good Analogy for Programming</p>

            <p>First, there are patterns to our every day lives. The universe operates in a somewhat predictable way;
                For example — day and night, seasons, sunrise and sunset. People go through routines such as rising in
                the morning, going to school or to work. We get instructions from other people such as our superiors at
                work. How we cook certain recipes can be explained in finite steps.</p>

            <p>Second, every time we use smart devices, some code is running in the background. Moving a mouse pointer
                from one part of your computer screen to the other may seem like a simple task, but in reality, so many
                lines of code just ran. An act as simple as typing letters into Google Docs leads to lines of code being
                executed in the background. It’s all code everywhere.</p>

            <p>Computer programs are also referred to as code. Do not use the word ‘codes’ (code should be used as an
                uncountable noun). Okay, this is not an English class, let’s get back to business.</p>

            <p>The Natural Language of the Computer</p>

            <p>Machines have their natural language like humans do. Computers do not understand the human language. The
                natural language of computers is the binary code — 1 and 0. These represent two states: on (1) and off
                (0).</p>

            <p>That is the natural language of electronic equipment. It would be hectic for us as humans to communicate
                with the computer in binary.</p>

            <p>Enter Programming Languages</p>

            <p>To communicate with machines who speak binary, we do so in a language that’s closer to our own natural
                language. Such as English, French, Swahili or Arabic. Programming languages are close to our natural
                languages. But they are more structured and must be thoroughly learned.</p>

            <p>They could be high level or low level languages. High level programming languages are farther away from
                the machine language than low level languages. This “farther away” is usually called an abstraction ,
                but we will not go into that in this series. Let’s not get distracted :)</p>

            <p>The computer needs a way to understand our human language. To do this, we’ll need a translator that can
                interprete code languages such as CSS. e.g. CSS background white.</p>
            <code class="code">body {background: white;}

            <p>In computer science, the <em>syntax</em> of a computer language is the rules that defines the
                combinations of symbols that are considered to be correctly structured statements or expressions in that
                language. e.g. HTML is as follows;</p>

            <p>What Is HTML?</p>

            <p>HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language, is a pretty simple language. It consists of different
                elements which we use to structure a web page.</p>
            <p>What is CSS?</p>
            <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language that is used to style your web content.</p>
            <code class="code">.container p {
             color: red;
            }</code>
            <p>What is JavaScript?</p>
            <p>JavaScript allows you to make dynamic web sites. It's the final part of the web development trinity with
                HTML and CSS, and you use it to make your static pages dynamic. JavaScript is made up of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Variables</li>
                <li>Conditionals</li>
                <li>Loops</li>
                <li>Arrays</li>
                <li>Functions</li>
                <li>Objects</li>

            <p>How to Use the Descendant Combinator</p>

            <p>This combinator allows you to select an element that is a descendant of another element. "Descendants"
                here can be child, grandchild, great-grandchild, great-great-great...and so on.</p>

            <p>To use this combinator, you enter an empty space between selectors like this:</p>
            <code class="code">
            .container div p {
            color: red;
            }
            </code>
        <p>To use a pseudo element, enter ::</p>
        <code class="code">
        selector::pseudo-element {
        property: value;
         }
        </code>

            <p>What Is an Array in JavaScript?</p>

            <p>An array in JavaScript is a variable that you can use to store multiple elements. It is usually in the
                form of square brackets that contain different elements, strings, and integers (or both strings and
                integers).</p>
            <p>What Is a Loop in JavaScript?</p>

            <p>A loop is a conditional statement used to run a sequence of instructions until a specified condition is
                met. It is given a statement that repeats the execution of a block of code and ends the execution once
                the stated condition is met.</p>

            <p>Let's loop through this array – let name = ['Dennis', 'Precious', 'Evelyn'], – using one of the most
                commonly used loops in JavaScript.</p>
            <p>How to Loop Through an Array with a For Loop in JavaScript</p>

            <p>A for loop is a statement that repeats the execution of a block of code when the condition is false and
                terminates the execution when the condition is true.</p>

            <p>Let's now loop through an array using the for loop method.</p>

            <p>I definitely advise that you go through this article carefully to not miss vital details along the way.
                But in case you are in a hurry to loop through an array using the for loop statement, you can check out
                the syntax below.
                Quick for loop explanation:</p>

            <p>This is the fast route to looping through an array using the for loop statement with an example.</p>
            <code class="code">let name = ['Dennis', 'Precious', 'Evelyn'];
             for (let i = 0; i <= name.length; i++)
            {console.log(name);
            }</code>
